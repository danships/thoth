This is a Next.js application, managed with pnpm.

The application uses Next.js 15 with React 19, Mantine UI 8 as the UI framework, and TypeScript.
It uses the Atomic Design Methodology for the UI components. Routes are managed with Next.js App Router.
API routes are implemented using Next.js API routes in the `src/app/api/` directory.
Preferred is using types instead interfaces in TypeScript.

## Styling

- Always use CSS modules (`.module.css` files) for component-specific styles instead of inline `<style>` tags.
- CSS module files should be named after their corresponding component file (e.g., `component-name.module.css` for `component-name.tsx`).
